## Instructions
* Click the canvas to create beautiful patterns
* Change the settings by clicking the icon in the top left

## Background
Revolutions is a drawing application allows for simple construction of the symbols symmetrical patterns based on user inputs.
By taking advantage of radial symmetry and mathematical principles, you can create beautiful designs with minimal effort. The generator works by dividing a circle into a set number of regions, with a drawing in any one of these regions being replicated in the rest, creating a patterned symmetrical circle.

## Features
Features Include:
* Choose the number of division on the circle
* Choose the pen width
* Choose the pen color
* Choose the background color
* Clear the board
* Create a Polygon Mode  where the pattern renders as a square not a circle
* Create a mirror mode which reflects the image in a section down the middle of each section


## Architecture and Technologies
The project used the following technologies:
* Javascript for logic
* CanvasJS for an interactive user drawing experience
* Webpack to bundle js files

## Future Plans
* Change the number of sides on Polygon Mode
* Download your drawing
